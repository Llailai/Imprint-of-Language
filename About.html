                    <p>"Imprint of Language" is a design project that is
                        deeply rooted in the author's personal experiences
                        and emotional journey during overseas study amid
                        the global COVID-19 pandemic. The project aims
                        to explore the role of intelligent machines in the
                        context of a new language system and its impact on
                        emotional communication between individuals after
                        undergoing artificial active operation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Through research and exploration of this "new
                        language system," the author seeks to understand
                        how it affects their emotional communication and
                        information transmission within these important
                        relationships. By doing so, the project aims to open
                        a real conversation box in a romantic and abstract
                        manner, allowing for the sharing and passing on of
                        stories and experiences.</p>

                    <p>The project seeks to delve into the potential effects
                        of language under by intelligent machines, on the
                        way people communicate and connect emotionally.
                        The focus on emotions and personal experiences in
                        the context of the COVID-19 pandemic could make
                        the project both relevant and relatable to a broader
                        audience. The abstract and creative approach
                        suggests that the author aims to evoke feelings and
                        reflections through the art project.</p>
